My first impression was a wow! after the kotlin introduction there are not only a series of the most important design patterns, which I knew a pair of them before from java, also antipatterns are explained and even concurrency using coroutines was a surprise for me because I didn&amp;rsquo;t use to think that design patterns and concurrency was related each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
