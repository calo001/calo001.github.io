My first impression was a wow! after the kotlin introduction there are not only a series of the most important design patterns, which I knew a pair of them before from java, also antipatterns are explained and even concurrency using coroutines was a surprise for me because I didn&amp;rsquo;t use to think that design patterns and concurrency was related each other.</description></item><item><title>Why I use elementary OS</title><link>https://calo001.github.io/p/why-i-use-elementary-os/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://calo001.github.io/p/why-i-use-elementary-os/</guid><description>ðŸ’Œ My history Like many people some years ago I used to have a computer with Windows XP and technical requirement very poor. For years it works fine to me, but often it got viruses by using a diskette or a USB device from another person or by going to a cybercafÃ©. My older brother always has been an enthusiast of technology and the Linux world. He installed Ubuntu on the computer with a dual boot and it was my starting point for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
