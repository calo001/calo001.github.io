For years it works fine to me, but often it got viruses by using a diskette or a USB device from another person or by going to a cybercafÃ©. My older brother always has been an enthusiast of technology and the Linux world. He installed Ubuntu on the computer with a dual boot and it was my starting point for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
