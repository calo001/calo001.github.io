[{"content":"My thoughts This book is a must to read if you want to give a try the KMP in a personal or professional project or even if you aren\u0026rsquo;t an optimism about multiplatform technologies but cross-platform or pure native, because learning a different perspective makes you realize things you can improve.\nIn my personal experience, I have been a native Android developer, and when a see projects and the growth of technologies like React or Flutter, I always thought that maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the future for mobile apps and beyond (web, desktop, etc). The optimism of the multiplatform idea had not convinced me at all, now after reading this book I\u0026rsquo;m sure that it will be a huge technology.\nFrom section 1 I learn the importance of multiplatform technology over cross-platform. Because any platform has its uniques features, evolves, needs, and compatibilities, using the cross-flatforms approach can lead to deficiencies and they end up breaking the idea of one code to all platforms. This can force the developers to learn the native platforms and also the cross-platform. The perfect use for cross-platform is for small projects but large projects with a lot of functionalities and the urge for optimization and nativeness, the only way is to go full either with the native or multiplatform. Multiplatform lets you decide how much code to share and lets us shine each platform with its unique and specific tools.\nThen the book explores how the KMP compilers works, the explanation is good and has various diagrams and examples. Is a good overview of what is inside a project like this.\nThe final part of section 1 (Introducing Kotlin for Swift Developers ) was a little confusing for me because I have little experience with iOS development, but at the same time, I could understand some differences and similitudes between Kotlin and Swift.\nSection 2 was my favorite! because the author teaches you to step by step how to start a new project using Android Studio, the tools needed. The example is basic but complete to learn how to use libraries to fetch data from local databases of the network.\nSection 3 is very interesting because is full of personal experience and the author let you know some difficulties and considerations applicable to the actual state of the KMM. In this last section, I\u0026rsquo;d like to have more examples because it was very theoretical.\nFinally, I recommend this book to be read as soon as possible because KMP continues its development and changes can make the content in this book outdated.\n More info Simplifying Application Development with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile: Write robust native applications for iOS and Android efficiently, by R√≥bert Nagy on Amazon.com\nMore info: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801812586/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_X0NHAPQDYGYDT9GE1BYW\n","date":"2022-05-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://calo001.github.io/p/simplifying-application-development-with-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile/03-kotlin-my-review-book_hucbccbf3bc5c0e71e163c4b381df8be94_556801_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://calo001.github.io/p/simplifying-application-development-with-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile/","title":"Simplifying Application Development with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile"},{"content":"My thoughts In the beginning, I was intrigued when I saw the book index because there is a complete overview of the design patterns and even more. My first impression was a wow! after the kotlin introduction there are not only a series of the most important design patterns, which I knew a pair of them before from java, also antipatterns are explained and even concurrency using coroutines was a surprise for me because I didn\u0026rsquo;t use to think that design patterns and concurrency was related each other.\nThe first section is adequate to get a refresh of the language for programmers that are not very familiar with it. Then the author explains each design pattern inside its classification, structured in a description, sometimes using analogies and a code example it feels complete and makes you understand in a better way the pattern. The only negative aspect of the description is that I would like to find some diagrams or even an extra example of some patterns that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand well.\nSection 2: Reactive and Concurrent Patterns, was for me the most interesting but most difficult part of the book. It was difficult because I think that reactive programming is a subject for a complete book, but the intention of the author was to relate the use of patterns not only in the previous description, but also in other programming related techniques, and that was amazing, I learn a lot of how concurrency works and its importance in performance and best practices. Recently I\u0026rsquo;m using a lot of kotlin Flows in my projects, this lecture gives me a better understanding of how it works and its relation with channels.\nThe last section: Practical Application of Design Patterns was a surprise for me. Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t match the idea of relating libraries like Ktor or Vert. x (I didn\u0026rsquo;t know this after reading this book) with design patterns, but finally after reading this book I was surprised to discover that a lot of design patterns are there and I used them before without knowing.\nFinally, I recommend this book for any person that uses kotlin and want to boost their understanding of the language on self and the libraries or frameworks you use every day. I\u0026rsquo;m sure this lecture can change your perspective of the importance of knowing design patterns and improving as a developer. Kotlin has already some designs implemented, there is no need to think a lot about how to try some designs patterns in your code and this is awesome!\n More info Kotlin Design Patterns and Best Practices: Build scalable applications using traditional, reactive, and concurrent design patterns in Kotlin, 2nd Edition by Alexey Soshin on Amazon.com\nMore info: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801815720/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_QJQ12H8PG3WFPM9P2JYB\n","date":"2022-04-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://calo001.github.io/p/kotlin-design-patterns-and-best-practices/02-kotlin-my-review-book_hube079928b55edc6d819d367614d401f3_530662_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://calo001.github.io/p/kotlin-design-patterns-and-best-practices/","title":"Kotlin Design Patterns and Best Practices"},{"content":"üì¶ What is Jetbrains' Toolbox App The Toolbox App is the best way of installing any Jetbrains software and Android Studio, which I\u0026rsquo;v knowm so far.

For years it works fine to me, but often it got viruses by using a diskette or a USB device from another person or by going to a cybercaf√©. My older brother always has been an enthusiast of technology and the Linux world. He installed Ubuntu on the computer with a dual boot and it was my starting point for me.\nUbuntu worked very well for me, but one thing I couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept at all was the UI. Fortunately, at That time the themes for Ubuntu were very popular, I often visited sites like www.gnome-look.org where I discovered ways to change the look and feel of Ubuntu with beautiful themes and icon packs. When Windows Vista and Windows Seven were released with transparencies, animations, icons, and so on I just got amazed about that and I wished for a way of getting that view without left using Linux. Fortunately, There was a very famous transformation pack for Ubuntu and I tried several times, the result was amazing even on my old computer. But there was a negative thing about it, I was very curious about customization and I always looked for ways of changing an icon or a color in the interface. Therefore, I often broke the UI, and then this made me reinstall Ubuntu several times, so it was tedious in the end.\nWhen GNOME 3 came out, I was fascinated by its appearance and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to try it out. Unfortunately, GNOME 3 was extremely heavy for my computer because it get frizzed very often after a pair of minutes. I liked how it looks like but it was unusable for me, so I decided to search for other alternatives. I installed a distro with KDE and even I tried Linux Mint, both were very good options. KDE was interesting for me because the whole system looks very different than my previous experiences with other DE, but I gave up, due to the design of some elements that seemed very old to me. On the other hand, Cinnamon was very kind, and I used it for a long time but finally, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get used to it.\nNext, I found an interesting project called Pear OS, which was a Linux distribution that took inspiration from Mac OS, and I decided to try it because it caught my eye. For my bad, when I installed it just didn\u0026rsquo;t work, the installer failed and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t give it a try.\nDisappointment of the unsuccessful installation, I continue using Cinnamon because it works better than nothing, but even Cinamon started to have problems with my computer like having freezings, slow startings, etc. Suddenly, surfing the internet I found blog posts that were talking about elementary OS and how it tried to imitate (not really) the Mac OS look and feel. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember where I read about it, I think maybe on Genbeta or hipertextual from Gabriela Gonzalez like üîó this post.\nThe first thing that elementary OS caught my attention was its top bar known as Wingpanel, it remembered me to the top panel of GNOME 3, and I thought that elementary os was a fork or it was a modified GNOME 3 (I was wrong). I decided to install it, I prepared the USB to create a bootable drive and try it even without a complete installation.\nWhen I use the elementary OS for the first time I got fascinated by how visual elements look on screen, icons, shadows, colors, and even the wallpaper was incredible. The first version I tried was Jupiter but at that time Luna was in early development. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what version to install but I tried both and unfortunately, I was in a dilemma. I love the app launcher in the Jupiter version but Luna looked more attractive to me, the app launcher in Luna I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it at all that time but finally, I decided to go with Luna.\nelementary OS Luna wasn\u0026rsquo;t the perfect OS, it has bugs with their Files application, and sometimes it frizzed like other distributions I have tried before. But it works much better definitively, It was the only distribution that I could use fine and let me do my homework, surf the internet, and do what I wanted to do. And with the time I grow my use and\n üîñ My favorites features Now I\u0026rsquo;d like to share some of my favorites features of elementary OS:\n Multitasking view The multitasking view is the most loved feature I have. It\u0026rsquo;s very usable and easy to configure using either a touchpad or mouse. For me, using a mouse is faster than the touchpad because if you configure your hot corners you can make a fast and intuitive movement of the hand and the multitasking view appears. Using a touchpad has two options: the first is the same as using the mouse but you have to move your cursor to the respective corner, but the new and fancy way is using touchpad gestures with three or four fingers (depending on your configuration) and multitasking view appears.  Wingpanel indicators The Wingpanel (The dark top bar) has useful indicators and options, e.g., The volume indicator lets you manage different inputs and outputs devices. Also if you scroll up/down over the volume icon you can adjust the device volume, so that\u0026rsquo;s very useful. The notification indicator allows you to check previous notifications but the more important is that it lets you mute all notifications when you need no disturbs. Of course, you have a typical indicator for configuring the brightness, internet, even a calendar!  AppCenter Although App center with its default configuration doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide some software that I use in my day-to-day, I can find useful or interesting apps to try like Eddy, Khronos, Planner, and other apps, which I can discover and have fun with. Fortunately, AppCenter allows you to add external repositories for that reason I always add the Flathub repository, then I can download apps like Firefox, Chromium, Flatseal, VSCode, VLC Media Player, and so on.  Login Screen There is nothing special about it, but the login screen is pretty and the UX is amazing, e.g., indicating the status of Caps Lock or failing the password.   üíª How I use elementary OS   I usually read pdf files for studying English and I always need a music player too. Using multitasking view and keyboard shortcuts is very kind to navigate between those apps.\n  I currently have two apps in AppCenter, naturally I need an elementary OS for the development and maintenance.\n  I love using elementary OS when I want to try some unrelated to mobile development like trying a new language programming or doing things like this website.\n   üéÜ Conclusion And that\u0026rsquo;s it. I had become a fan of the elementary community following the official accounts from developers and founders (Danielle and Cassidy) and official channels like their Twitter account. It is incredible to see how they interact with their users and they are very kind people. And finally, I\u0026rsquo;ll continue using the elementary OS for many years.\n","date":"2022-02-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://calo001.github.io/p/why-i-use-elementary-os/01-linux-cover_hu9dc1b5efddcfe1a4ad89eabab0b25ef0_427698_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://calo001.github.io/p/why-i-use-elementary-os/","title":"Why I use elementary OS"},{"content":"üí° What is kotlin?
